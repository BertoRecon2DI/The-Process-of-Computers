            <hi style="color:#0effff"><strong>The Abacus</strong></hi>
            Is an ancient device used over 5000 years over its creation, mainly to assist in
            counting a certain number of objects that outnumbered human physical features such as using fingers to
            count.
            The abacus like other devices in its time were used to count large numbers in general for various purposes.

            <hi style="color:#0effff"><strong>Pascal's Calculator</strong></hi>
            Invented by<strong>Blaise Pascal</strong>,the machine was a mechanical device used as the first adding
            machine
            later known as the calculator used between 1642 and 1644 which would give a general idea that would be a
            stepping stone for later inventions in the future.

            Born December 26, 1791
            <hi style="color:#0effff"><strong>Charles Babbage</strong></hi>
            Was one of four children born to the banker Benjamin
            Babbage. Charles would study mathematics at Trinity, Cambridge and graduated without honors from Peterhouse
            in 1814. He was responsible for designing the first automatic computing engines. Invented the computers but
            failed to build them. The first was made in 2002 in London.

        <p><strong>Punch Cards</strong>

            Made by
            <hi style="color:#0effff"><strong>Herman Hollerith</strong></hi>
            , the device is simply a piece of stiff paper that would contain digital information
            represented by the presence or absence of holes in predefined positions. The information might be data for
            data processing applications or, in earlier examples, used to directly controlling automated machinery,
            widely used in the 20th century which is what later became known as the data processing industry, some
            <strong>punch cards</strong> are still in use today as to record votes.

            <hi style="color:#0effff"><strong>Herman Hollerith (1860-1929)</strong></hi>

            Born February 29, 1860, Herman Hollerith was an American Inventor who developed an <strong>electromechanical
            punched card
            tabulator</strong> to assist in summarizing information and later accounting. He would then be the founder
            of
            <strong>The Tabulating Machine Company</strong> that was consolidated in 1911 with three other companies to
            from the
            Computing Tabulating-Recording Company. Herman is regarded as one of the seminal figures in the development
            of data processing which would lead to the improvement and development of future computers.

            The programming language <strong>C++</strong>(originally named “C” with classes) was devised by <strong>Bjarne
            Stroustrup</strong> who was also an
            employee from <strong>Bell Labs</strong> (AT&T) in 1979. Was a startup point for programming language that
            would eventually
            progress into <strong>Java</strong> for programming essential point in programming.

            Projects
            Agency Network known as <strong>“ARPANET”</strong> which had ideally made many of the protocols used for
            internet communication

            originally experimented with different pursuits before starting Apple Computer with
            <hi style="color:#0effff"><strong>Steve Wozniak</strong></hi>
            in
            1976. One of his first inventions the <strong>“blue box”</strong> was a simple electronic gizmo that had
            passed the telephone
            company billing computers, allowing anyone to make free telephone calls anywhere in the world, despite being
            illegal for speculations of hacking into a telephone company journal. Eventually sparking passion, a passion
            to the youth to build electronics and helping in ushering a new era of technology that is computers.

            as a training exercise later became one of the first video games to be created
            and serves as a foothold for future games. Acknowledged as one of the earliest arcade videogames and very
            first sports arcade videogame. Quickly becoming a success and is the first commercially successful
            video game machine. This would then in turn help establish the video game industry.

            <hi style="color:#0effff"><strong>Atari</strong></hi>

            The original <strong>Atari Inc.</strong> founded in 1972 by <strong>Nolan Bushnell</strong> and <strong>Ted
            Dabney</strong> was a pioneer in arcade games. One of
            its most successful products was the arcade game <strong>Pong</strong> a simple game of two white bars
            bouncing a white pixel
            in between in each other until the pixel would pass a bar scoring a point. Mainly Atari is responsible for
            helping define the electronic entertainment industry in the 1970’s to the mid-1980’s.
            <hi style="color:#0effff"><strong>Atari</strong></hi>
            is one company
            that left a foot hold for video games gaining mass popularity worldwide shaping the gaming industry of today
